## Explanations
The Login Page is a program designed to provide user authentication and access control. 
It allows users to register if they don't already have an account and provides separate 
pages for regular users and administrators.

User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their desired email and password.
If the user already exists, they can simply log in using their credentials.
User Page: Once logged in as a regular user, users are redirected to a dedicated user page. 

Admin Page: Administrators have their own separate page with additional privileges.
They can access the admin panel, which allows them to manage user accounts and perform administrative tasks.

User Management: Within the admin panel, administrators can disable or enable user accounts as needed.
This feature gives administrators control over user access to the system.
User Deletion: Administrators also have the ability to delete user accounts permanently from the system. 
This feature helps to maintain user data integrity and security.
Registration Date: The system keeps track of the registration date and time for each user. 
This information can be accessed by administrators to monitor user activity and registration patterns.
